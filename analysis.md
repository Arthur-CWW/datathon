## Water usage

## Possible Solutions
May want to internalise the externalities to change the behaviour of farmers to choose more water efficient per price of crops, or engineer more water efficient strains

Even though this solution makes sense economically and environmentally, it does not make sense politically, since in many countries farmers make a sizeable voter base / demographic.
